This repository contains my completed solution for The Odin Project's "Landing Page" assignment within the Foundations course.

This project demonstrates core HTML and CSS mastery by replicating a complex website layout from scratch. It utilizes Flexbox for responsive layout design, focusing on creating a clean, structured, and visually appealing page that is consistent across different screen sizes.

Key Skills Demonstrated:
1) Semantic HTML5: Proper use of structural elements (<header>, <section>, <footer>).

2) CSS Flexbox: Building dynamic and responsive sections for navigation, hero, and content blocks.

3) CSS Fundamentals: Custom font imports, color palettes, and margin/padding management for precise design replication.
